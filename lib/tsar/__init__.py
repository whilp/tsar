"""\
tsar provides a simple HTTP API for archiving and retrieving time-series
data. It uses the `Redis`_ key-value store to provide fast access to
stored records. New records can be sent via HTTP POST singly or in bulk.
Clients may request ranges of data limited by timestamps; the server can
perform a number of common tasks (ie downsampling) on the resulting data
before returning it to the client.
